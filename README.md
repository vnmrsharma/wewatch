# WeWatch - Discover, Play, Protect Together.

Hey there! 👋 
WeWatch is a community-powered platform that puts the pulse of your local environment at your fingertips—combining real-time climate data, NASA satellite imagery, live weather, and AI insights. It transforms environmental challenges into interactive learning and real-world action, empowering everyone—everywhere—to see, understand, and protect their world.

### Cool Features:
- 🌍 **Real-time environmental data** for your location
- 🌤️ **Weather forecasts** and air quality monitoring  
- 🛰️ **NASA satellite imagery** and data visualization
- 🎮 **Interactive learning games** (including an ocean cleanup game!)
- 🤖 **AI-powered insights** about your local environment
- ♿ **Fully accessible** - works great with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need:
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- A code editor (VS Code works great)
- An internet connection (for the APIs)

### Quick Setup:

1. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Go to `http://localhost:5173` and you're good to go!

### First Time Setup:
When you first open the app, it'll ask you to set up your profile. Just enter your name and location - that's it! The app will automatically start pulling environmental data for your area.

## How to Use It

1. **Dashboard**: Your main hub showing current environmental conditions
2. **Action Drives**: Community features and environmental initiatives  
3. **EcoPal**: AI assistant that can answer questions about climate and environment
4. **Learning Wall**: Interactive games and educational content about climate science

## Technical Stuff (For Developers)

This is built with:
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **NASA APIs** for satellite data
- **Weather APIs** for current conditions

The app is designed to be super accessible and works great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Note: Don't Forget to get your API Keys for all the data access when you are trying to run this amazing project locally.

## Need Help?

If something's not working:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again
3. Check that your internet connection is working (the app needs to fetch data from APIs)

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this project and make it even better! The code is clean, well-commented, and follows modern React best practices.
